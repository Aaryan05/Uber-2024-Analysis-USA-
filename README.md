📄 Mini Report Summary
Project Title: Uber Ride Data Analysis using Power BI
Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, Python
Data Sources:

Trip details with time, fare, and distance

Location mapping (pickup & drop-off)

🧩 Uniqueness of the Analysis:
Integrated Pickup & Drop Mapping: Locations enriched via ID mapping create a more intuitive geographic analysis.

Dynamic Surge Fee Visualizations: Tracked how surge fees influence trip cost and time of day.

Trip Duration Engineering: Custom metric to reveal inefficiencies and high-duration clusters.

Passenger Count vs Fare: Highlighted how ride-sharing frequency affects profit distribution.

📈 Key Insight:
"Trips starting from high-traffic hubs (like Newark Airport) during peak evening hours (5–8 PM) consistently generate 20–30% higher revenue with minimal increase in ride time."

This pattern suggests a high ROI window for drivers and fleet managers to capitalize on.
